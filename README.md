# BYU Code Challenge

This is a NodeJS and Angular application.

### To start the application

#### make sure you run npm install in both directories.

run `npm start` in both the webapp and webservice Directory.

I did not work on the front end at all mostly backend work.

I am willing to learn anything you need me to. I really enjoyed the work needed to take part in this test.

a minor note. when connecting to the API the Eduroam network blocks access.
